## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Doing away with old 62.5% rem font hack, used calc() instead.

### Continued development

My focus is still on Angular as I am doing projects using this skill professionally. I am doing the Frontend Mentor challenges to keep up with the latest developments in frontend development - having UI already available takes away the need for me to find more samples. As part of continuous learning I plan to learn more frontend frameworks such as React as well as keep up with the backend technologies.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Custom Properties](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/) - This site never rans out of simple to understand and useful resources. I like the brevity and straightforwardness of their articles. This is just one of them. Most of their articles also doubles up as a cheat sheets.
