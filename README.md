## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Doing away with old 62.5% rem font hack, used calc() instead.

### Continued development

I will still be focusing on Angular. I am just trying to keep up with the latest developments in frontend and its best practices. Although I am doing Angular professionally, eventually I plan to learn React as there is a transition of projects towards this skill as well.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Custom Properties](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/) - This site never rans out of simple to understand and useful resources. I like the brevity and straightforwardness of their articles. This is just one of them. Most of their articles also doubles up as a cheat sheets.
